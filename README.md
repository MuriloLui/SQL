World Populations SQL Practice
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy.
Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended 
requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to
correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, 
Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
You’ll work with a dataset of world population by country data from recent years. You’ll 
write queries to retrieve interesting data and answer a set of specific questions.


-- How many entries in the database are from Africa?
-- What was the total population of Oceania in 2005?
-- What is the average population of countries in South America in 2003?
-- What country had the smallest population in 2007?
-- What is the average population of Poland during the time period covered by this dataset?
-- How many countries have the word "The" in their name?
-- What was the total population of each continent in 2010?
